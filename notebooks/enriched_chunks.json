The number of shares subject to the Initial Ochoa RSU was calculated in the same manner as the 2024 Program RSUs, but using the 30-calendar day trailing average closing price that ended the business day before her appointment.\n\nDeferred Compensation Program\n\nNon-employee directors can elect to defer the settlement of RSUs upon vesting for tax planning purposes. Deferrals can be made to the earlier of (i) the third Wednesday of March of a future year (no sooner than 2026 for the 2024 Program RSUs and Prorated Ochoa RSU, or 2028 for the Initial Ochoa RSU) or (ii) the director\u2019s cessation of service or certain change-in-control events, in accordance with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code.\n\nOther Compensation/Benefits\n\nOur directors are reimbursed for expenses incurred in attending Board and committee meetings, and continuing educational programs. We do not offer change-in-control benefits to directors, except for vesting acceleration under our equity plans that applies to all plan award holders if an acquirer does not assume or substitute those awards, provided that the award holder\u2019s continuous service with us has not terminated prior to the change-in-control. If a director\u2019s service terminates due to death, their RSU grants will immediately vest in full.\n\nDirectors do not receive dividends on unvested, or vested but deferred, RSUs.\n\n38\n\nTable of Contents\n\nDirector Compensation for Fiscal 2025",

Shares that count toward the ownership guidelines include those held directly by the NEO, in trust for the NEO or immediate family, and vested but deferred shares, but not unvested equity awards. NEOs have up to five years from appointment to reach their ownership threshold. These\n\n53\n\nTable of Contents\n\nguidelines are intended to align NEO interests with stockholder interests. Each NEO currently exceeds the stock ownership requirements.\n\nCompensation Recovery Policy\n\nWe have maintained a Compensation Recovery Policy since 2009, and amended it in 2023 to comply with Nasdaq\u2019s listing standards. Our policy requires the Company to recover certain incentive compensation from current or former executive officers in connection with certain restatements of financial statements, if the compensation exceeds the amount that the officers would have received based on the restated financial statements, subject to limited exceptions.\n\nTax and Accounting Implications\n\nUnder Section 162(m), compensation paid to each of the Company\u2019s \u201ccovered employees\u201d that exceeds $1 million per year is generally non-deductible. The CC considers various factors when making its decisions and retains flexibility to provide non-deductible compensation if consistent with the Company\u2019s executive compensation program goals and the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. The CC may also modify compensation that was initially intended to be exempt from the deduction limit if the modifications are consistent with the Company\u2019s business needs. The CC also considers the impact of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code and strives to avoid possible adverse tax consequences.",

In 2024, we amended our Bylaws to let stockholders owning at least 15% of our shares for a minimum of one year request a special meeting. Since then, we\u2019ve engaged with many of our largest stockholders and none raised concerns about the one-year holding period. Removing this requirement could allow a minority of stockholders who have not held a financial stake in NVIDIA for a meaningful period of time to call special meetings and waste NVIDIA\u2019s resources, ultimately harming our stockholders. The current special meeting right strikes a balance between enabling urgent action and protecting NVIDIA and its stockholders from narrow, short-term interests.\n\nSpecial meetings demand substantial time, effort, and management resources, and our one-year holding period is a reasonable safeguard.\n\nGiven NVIDIA\u2019s scale and broad stockholder base, calling a special meeting entails significant resource commitments. The associated legal, administrative and voting processes are time intensive and divert the Board and management from core business operations, potentially impacting stockholder value. Therefore, the Board believes special meetings should be limited to urgent, extraordinary matters initiated by stockholders with a substantial, long-term financial interest in the company.\n\nThe one-year holding period is consistent with the SEC\u2019s minimum for stockholders to include a proposal in our proxy statement.\n\nSEC Rule 14a-8 permits stockholders to include proposals in a company\u2019s proxy statement after holding shares for at least one year, reflecting the principle that proponents should have an economic stake for a meaningful time period before using company and stockholder resources. This same rationale underpins our one-year holding requirement for requesting special meetings.

Directors on the Board's Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will then review the tendered resignation and recommend to the Board whether to accept or reject it.\n\nThe proposed Resignation Guideline Policy sets a more demanding director resignation review process, requiring the Board to articulate a compelling reason or reasons when it rejects a tendered resignation, thus allowing an unelected director to continue to serve. Importantly, the Resignation Policy further establishes that if a \"holdover\" director again fails to be re-elected at the next annual meeting of shareholders, the new resignation is effective ninety days following the election vote certification.

The comprehensive, consistent, and standardized nature of EEO-1 data disclosure also facilitates comparison across firms. As NVIDIA is required to report EEO-1 data to the federal government, it is able to provide a more complete picture of its workforce without additional burdens on the company to collect data.\n\nWorkplace culture and human capital management programs are critical to a company\u2019s talent attraction and retention pipeline, which may affect both social equality and financial performance.2 As You Sow and Whistle Stop Capital reviewed the workforce diversity of 1,641 companies between 2016-2021, finding statistically significant positive correlations between manager diversity and return on equity, return on invested capital, and 10-year revenue growth, among other indicators.3\n\nImplementing more robust reporting via the disclosure of EEO-1 data would provide transparency and insight to investors, employees, and stakeholders. Further, comparing the data collected to internal and external standards and peers may enhance talent management, workplace culture strategy, and promote employee retention. Subsequent disclosures around these activities would enable investors to better understand and assess NVIDIA\u2019s human capital management trends and performance.\n\n1 https://diversiq.com/blog/whats-new-this-proxy-season-trends-at-the-halfway-point/\n\n2 https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/30/diversity-equity-and-inclusion-are-important-to-workers-survey-shows.html\n\n3 https://www.asyousow.org/report-page/2023-capturing-the-diversity-benefit\n\n73\n\nTable of Contents\n\nOpposing Statement of the Board\n\nOur Board recommends a vote AGAINST Proposal 7 because it believes it is unnecessary and not in the best interests of NVIDIA and our stockholders.\n\nWe publish robust workforce and diversity data.",

As a result of these new requirements, we incurred a $4.5 billion charge in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 associated with H20 for excess inventory and purchase obligations, as the demand for H20 diminished. In August 2025, the USG granted licenses that would allow us to ship certain H20 products to certain China-based customers, but to date, we have not generated any revenue or shipped any H20 products under those licenses. USG officials have expressed an expectation that the USG will receive 15% of the revenue generated from licensed H20 sales, but to date, the USG has not published a regulation codifying such requirement. In the second quarter, we recognized approximately $650 million of H20 revenue from sales to an unrestricted customer outside of China, resulting in a $180 million release of previously reserved H20 inventory. There were no H20 sales to China-based customers in the second quarter.\n\nWe continue to execute Data Center compute product introductions, bringing new advanced architectures on a one-year product cadence. We began shipping production units of our new Blackwell Ultra platforms including GB300 in the second quarter of fiscal year 2026.

Since our original focus on PC graphics, we have expanded to several other large and important computationally intensive fields. Fueled by the sustained demand for exceptional 3D graphics and the scale of the gaming market, NVIDIA has leveraged its GPU architecture to create platforms for scientific computing, AI, data science, autonomous vehicles, robotics, and digital twin applications.\n\nOur two operating segments are \"Compute & Networking\" and \"Graphics,\" as described in Note 13 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\n\nHeadquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998.\n\nRecent Developments, Future Objectives and Challenges\n\nRevenue growth in the third quarter was driven by data center compute and networking platforms for accelerated computing and AI solutions.

In addition, access to capital can be particularly constrained for less-capitalized companies, which may face difficulties securing financing for large-scale infrastructure projects.

    "content": "In April 2025, the U.S. government, or USG, informed us that a license is required for exports of our H20 product into the China market. As a result of these new requirements, we incurred a $4.5 billion charge in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 associated with H20 for excess inventory and purchase obligations, as the demand for H20 diminished. In August 2025, the USG granted licenses that would allow us to ship certain H20 products to certain China-based customers, but to date, we have generated approximately $50 million in H20 revenue under those licenses. USG officials have expressed an expectation that the USG will receive 15% or more of the revenue generated from licensed sales of our products, but to date, the USG has not published a regulation codifying such requirement.\n\nIn January 2025, the USG published the \u201cAI Diffusion\u201d Interim Final Rule, or IFR, in the Federal Register. The IFR would have imposed a worldwide licensing requirement on our most recent data center products, such as our H200, GB200 and GB300. In May 2025, the USG announced that it would rescind the AI Diffusion IFR and implement a replacement rule. The scope, timing, and requirements of the forthcoming rule remain uncertain. The replacement rule may impose new restrictions on our products or operations and/or add license requirements that could have a material impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition. For example, in October 2025, the Senate passed the \u201cGAIN AI Act\u201d in the National Defense Authorization Act, or the NDAA. The GAIN AI Act would restrict the Trump Administration\u2019s ability to adapt the Biden Administration\u2019s export control rules and could also allow private U.S. persons to review and overturn licensing and foreign policy decisions made by the Trump Administration.",

Open-source AI is dependent on developer adoption and if deployed on our competitors\u2019 platforms, it could reduce demand for our products and services.\n\nThe rapid evolution of global trade policies, such as export controls and tariffs, has added complexity and increased costs throughout our supply chain, and these challenges are likely to persist. Ongoing uncertainty regarding the scope and application of such measures may adversely affect investment decisions by us and our partners, disrupt supply chain operations, and impact the timing and volume of customer purchases due to challenges in forecasting future costs and demand.\n\nWe are increasing our U.S.-based manufacturing and investing in specialized equipment and processes to support domestic production. This move is expected to strengthen our supply chain, add resiliency and redundancy, and meet the growing demand for AI infrastructure. Our ability to increase manufacturing capabilities will depend on the domestic manufacturing ecosystem's capacity to ramp production supply to the required volume and on a timely basis.\n\nMacroeconomic factors, including tariffs, inflation, interest rate changes, capital market volatility, global supply chain constraints, and global economic and geopolitical developments, have direct and indirect impacts on our results of operations, particularly demand for our products. While difficult to isolate and quantify, these macroeconomic factors impact our supply chain and manufacturing costs, employee wages, costs for capital equipment and value of our investments.

Export controls and other restrictions targeting GPUs and semiconductors associated with AI, which have been imposed and are likely to be more restrictive, would further limit our ability to export our technology, products, or services, creating a competitive disadvantage for us and negatively impacting our business and financial results. Export controls targeting GPUs and semiconductors associated with AI have subjected and may in the future subject downstream users of our products to restrictions on the use, resale, repair, or transfer of our products, negatively impacting our business and financial results. Controls could negatively impact our cost and/or ability to provide services such as NVIDIA AI cloud services and could impact the cost and/or ability for our CSPs and customers to provide services to their end customers, even outside China.\n\n38",

Our Blackwell GPU revenue ramp continued during the quarter, extending beyond large cloud service providers to include consumer internet companies and regional cloud service providers.\n\nOn April 9, 2025, the U.S. government, or USG, informed us that it requires a license for export to China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and D:5 countries, or to companies headquartered or with an ultimate parent therein, of our H20 integrated circuits and any other circuits achieving the H20\u2019s memory bandwidth, interconnect bandwidth, or combination thereof. As a result of these new requirements, we incurred a $4.5 billion charge in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 associated with H20 excess inventory and purchase obligations as the demand for H20 products diminished. The $4.5 billion charge was less than what we initially anticipated as we were able to re-use certain materials. Sales of our H20 products were $4.6 billion for the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 prior to the new export licensing requirements. The H20 export licensing requirements have impacted our current revenue and will also negatively affect our future revenue. We are still evaluating our limited options to supply Data Center compute products compliant with the USG\u2019s export control rules. The export controls applicable to China are complex and address a variety of parameters, including the total processing performance of a chip, the \u201cperformance density\u201d of a chip, the interconnect bandwidth of a chip, and the memory bandwidth of a chip. We may be unable to create a competitive product for China\u2019s data center market that receives approval from the USG. In that event, we would effectively be foreclosed from competing in China's data center computing/compute market, with a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition.\n\n22",

Ongoing uncertainty regarding the scope and application of such measures may adversely affect investment decisions by us and our partners, disrupt supply chain operations, and impact the timing and volume of customer purchases due to challenges in forecasting future costs and demand.\n\nWe plan to increase our U.S.-based manufacturing and invest in specialized equipment and processes to support domestic production.

During the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, the USG also informed us of an additional licensing requirement for a subset of A100 and H100 products destined to certain customers and other regions, including some countries in the Middle East.\n\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, the USG announced new and updated licensing requirements for exports to China and Country Groups D1, D4, and D5 (including but not limited to, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam, but excluding Israel) of our products exceeding certain performance thresholds, including, but not limited to, the A100, A800, H100, H800, L4, L40, L40S RTX 4090, GB200 NVL72, and B200. The licensing requirements also apply to the export of products exceeding certain performance thresholds to a party headquartered in, or with an ultimate parent headquartered in, Country Group D5, including China.\n\nOn April 9, 2025, the USG informed us that it requires a license for export to China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and D:5 countries, or to companies headquartered or with an ultimate parent therein, of our H20 integrated circuits and any other circuits achieving the H20\u2019s memory bandwidth, interconnect bandwidth, or combination thereof. As a result of these new requirements, we incurred a $4.5 billion charge in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 associated with H20 for excess inventory and purchase obligations, as the demand for H20 products diminished.",

On January 15, 2025, the USG published the \u201cAI Diffusion\u201d IFR in the Federal Register. After a 120-day delayed compliance period, the IFR would have imposed a worldwide licensing requirement on all products classified under Export Control Classification Numbers, or ECCNs, 3A090.a, 4A090.a, or corresponding .z ECCNs, including all related software and technology. The licensing requirement would have applied to our most popular data center products, such as our H200 and GB200. The AI Diffusion IFR would have divided the world into three tiers, relegating most countries to \u201cTier 2\u201d status, and would have created a complex and burdensome scheme for licensing approvals.\n\nIn May 2025, the USG announced that it would rescind the AI Diffusion IFR and implement a replacement rule.

We may be in various stages of transitioning the architectures of our Data Center, Gaming, Professional Visualization and Automotive products. The computing industry is experiencing a broader and faster launch cadence of accelerated computing platforms to meet a growing and diverse set of AI opportunities. We have introduced a new architecture cadence of our Data Center solutions where we seek to complete a new computing architecture each year and we are providing a greater variety of Data Center offerings.

The increased frequency and complexity of newly introduced products could result in quality or production issues that could increase inventory provisions, warranty, or other costs or result in product delays. We incur significant engineering development resources for new products, and changes to our product roadmap may impact our ability to develop other products or adequately manage our supply chain cost. Customers may delay purchasing existing products as we increase the frequency of new products or may not be able to adopt our new products as fast as forecasted, both impacting the timing of our revenue and supply chain cost.

The licensing requirements may benefit certain of our competitors, as the licensing process will make our pre-sale and post-sale technical support efforts more cumbersome and less certain and encourage customers in China to pursue alternatives to our products, including semiconductor suppliers based in China, Europe, and Israel.\n\nGiven the increasing strategic importance of AI and rising geopolitical tensions, the USG has changed and may again change the export control rules at any time and further subject a wider range of our products to export restrictions and licensing requirements, negatively impacting our business and financial results. In the event of such change, we may be unable to sell our inventory of such products and may be unable to develop replacement products not subject to the licensing requirements, effectively excluding us from all or part of the China market, as well as other impacted markets,\n\n38",

For example, the USG has already imposed conditions to limit the ability of foreign firms to create and offer as a service large-scale GPU clusters, for example by imposing license conditions on the use of products to be exported to certain countries, and may impose additional conditions such as requiring chip tracking and throttling mechanisms that could disable or impair GPUs if certain events, including unauthorized system configuration, use, or location, are detected. The USG has already imposed export controls restricting certain gaming GPUs, and if the USG expands such controls to restrict additional gaming products, it may disrupt a significant portion of our supply and distribution chain and negatively impact sales of such products to markets outside China, including the U.S. and Europe. In addition, as the performance of the gaming GPUs increases over time, export controls may have a greater impact on our ability to compete in markets subject to those controls. Export controls may disrupt our supply and distribution chain for a substantial portion of our products, which are warehoused in and distributed from Hong Kong. Export controls restricting our ability to sell data center GPUs may also negatively impact demand for our networking products used in servers containing our GPUs. The USG may also impose export controls on our networking products, such as high-speed network interconnects, to limit the ability of downstream parties to create large clusters for frontier model training. Any new control that impacts a wider range of our products would likely have a disproportionate impact on NVIDIA and may disadvantage us against certain of our competitors that sell chips that are outside the scope of such control.

The European Commission released a set of \u201cStandard Contractual Clauses\u201d designed for entities to validly transfer personal data out of the EEA to jurisdictions that the European Commission has not found to provide an adequate level of protection, including the United States. Additionally, the U.K.\u2019s International Data Transfer Agreement / Addendum, as well as the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework and the U.K. extension thereto (which allows for transfers to relevant U.S.-based organizations who self-certify compliance and participate in the Framework) are mechanisms that may be used to transfer personal data from the EEA and U.K. to the United States. However, these mechanisms are subject to legal challenges, and there is no assurance that we can satisfy or rely on these measures to lawfully transfer personal data to the United States. Other jurisdictions have enacted or are considering similar cross-border personal data transfer laws and local personal data residency laws, any of which would increase the cost and complexity of doing business and could result in fines from regulators. For example, China\u2019s law imposes various requirements relating to data processing and data localization. Data broadly defined as important under China\u2019s law, including personal data, may not be transferable outside of China without prior assessment and approval by the Cyberspace Administration of China, or CAC. Compliance with these requirements, including CAC assessments and any deemed failures of such assessments, could cause us to incur liability, prevent us from using data collected in China or impact our ability to transfer data outside of China. The inability to import personal data to the United States could significantly and negatively impact our business operations, limit our ability to collaborate with parties that are subject to European, China and other data privacy and security laws, or require us to increase our",

Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in other income or expenses. The impact of foreign currency transaction gain or loss included in determining net income was not significant for fiscal years 2025 and 2024.\n\nSales and arrangements with third-party manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in United States dollars, and, therefore, are not subject to exchange rate fluctuations.

Most of the Company\u2019s inventory provisions relate to excess quantities of products, based on the Company\u2019s inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions. As of January 26, 2025, the Company\u2019s consolidated inventories balance was $10.1 billion and the Company\u2019s consolidated outstanding inventory purchase and long-term supply and capacity obligations balance was $30.8 billion, of which a significant portion relates to inventory purchase obligations.",

This in turn led to significant auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management\u2019s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions.\n\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management\u2019s provisions for excess or obsolete inventories and excess product purchase commitments, including controls over management\u2019s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions. These procedures also included, among others, testing management\u2019s process for developing the provisions for excess or obsolete inventories and excess product purchase commitments; evaluating the appropriateness of management\u2019s approach; testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the approach; and evaluating the reasonableness of management\u2019s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions. Evaluating management\u2019s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering (i) current and past results, including historical product life cycle, (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data, and (iii) changes in technology.\n\n/s/\n\nFebruary 26, 2025\n\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 2004.\n\n51\n\nTable of Contents\n\nNVIDIA Corporation and Subsidiaries",
